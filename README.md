# Opencv cheat sheet


This is an ongoing project. I am a pyimagesearch (www.pyimagesearch.com) reader and bought some of Adrian Rosebrock's books online. I am compiling some of frequently used opencv commands for reference.

I am trying to separate imageprocessing functions into separate documents. Please feel free to explore this repository and I would be delighted if you can contribute to this project
